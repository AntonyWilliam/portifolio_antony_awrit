To complete the EmailJS setup for your contact form, follow these steps:

   - Go to [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and sign up for an account if you don't have one.

2. **Create an Email Service**:
   - ✅ Service ID: `service_8ca4upp` (already configured)

3. **Create an Email Template**:

     - `user_email`: For the sender's email

6. **Security Note**:
