  bio: `I'm a dedicated technical writer with 5 years of experience, specializing in creating clear, accessible documentation for complex technologies.
        
        My expertise lies in API documentation, UX writing, and breaking down complex technical concepts into understandable content for diverse audiences. I've worked with blockchain technologies, SaaS platforms, and developer tools to create comprehensive documentation that enhances user experience and reduces support needs.
        
        I believe that great documentation is as important as great code, and I'm passionate about creating content that empowers users and developers alike.`,
